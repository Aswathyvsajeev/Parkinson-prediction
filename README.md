##What is Parkinson's Disease? 
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic disease condition which affects parts of the brain and leads to damage of nerve cells.Tremor,stiffness and lack of flexibility are the main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.It can also lead to psychological problems like depression and anxiety. Men have more chance of having Parkinson’s disease compared to women. According to 2020 statistics UK,around 145,000 people have Parkinson’s disease and is estimated to rise around 172,000 by 2030.

###Project Overview 
-Different machine learning classifiers are developed with the goal of distinguishing people with Parkinson’s disease from healthy ones using dysphonia measures collected fro    patients 
-Performance of the models are compared to identify which model performs best. Support vector machine and K-Nearest Neighbor are compared to Artificial neural network 
 model. 
-Artificial neural network is built using Keras library in python 
-The dataset is collected from UCI repository.
-TO evaluate the performance of the models K-fold cross validation is used.In addition to that, for evaluating the model different performance matrices like confusion matrix,    sensitivity, precision, specificity, recall and F1 score are used.
